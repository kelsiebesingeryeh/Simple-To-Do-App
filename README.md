# Simple-To-Do-App

This was my first "to do list" that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I found several helpful tutorials online that helped walk me through the JavaScript portion since I am new to coding.  

I would love to iterate on this and create a full on project plan with more features and interactivity to help me in my coding journey. It was really fun to create!
